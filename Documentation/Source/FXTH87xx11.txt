\section FXTH87xx11-1 Example issues with FXTH87xx11
 
Some devices require programming ranges of the Flash memory while preserving other areas.  A good example of this is the FXTH87xx11. \n
The FXTH87xx11 comes pre-programmed with utility code that user programs are meant to access so it is necessary to program part of the Flash.
 
Before playing around with this chip I created an image of the chip contents.  
This allows the chip to be returned to a "factory fresh" state if the firmware is accidentally erased.

I have attached the image:
	- @htmlonly Image from a FXTH870511, <a href="FXTH870511_Image.sx.zip">FXTH870511_Image.sx</a> @endhtmlonly 

The USBDM HCS08 Programmmer provides two entries for use with this device:
	- <b>FXTH87xx11-Full-Erase</b> \n
		This is a device entry that allows completely unprotected programming of the device.  This can be used to re-program the device with the above image using mass-erase.
	- <b>FXTH87xx11</b> \n
		This is an entry that only allows programming the intended user area of the Flash.  
		Due to limitations in the USBDM programmer it is not possible to prevent you from mass-erasing the device  - You have to <b>manually select selective erase</b>.

    - Create a project in usual way with a USBDM target interface.\n
    - Modify the USBDM options as shown below\n
       - <b>Security field from flash image</b> (there won't be one)\n
       - <b>Selective erase (by sector)</b>\n
