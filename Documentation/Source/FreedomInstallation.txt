 \section FreedomHardwareModifications Hardware Modifications to FRDM-KL25Z
 
 Before using the FRDMxxxx board as an <b>external</b> Kinetis programmer it is necessary to make some hardware modifications.  The on-board chip
 may be programmed without modification so is useful as an initial test of the system before making hardware modifications.\n

 The modification detailed below are for the FRDM-KL25Z board.  Similar modifications are necessary for the other FRDM boards but the details will
 vary.

  - Cut the PCB trace on the <b>bottom</b> of the board under J11.  This trace connects the SWD hardware to the MKL25Z128M4 device on the board.  
    It must be opened to allow an external target to be connected without interference from the on-board chip.\n
    Connection to the on-board target may be restored by adding pins and a jumper at J11 on the top of the board.\n\n

    \n\n
  - Add a 10-pin connector at location J6 which is also marked SWD.  Do not confuse this with the similar connector at J8 marked SDA/SWD.\n
    A suitable connector would be Element-14 #681-1184.  This is an unprotected header.\n\n

    \n\n
  - Procure a 10-pin to 10-pin programming cable to connect to the target.  The cheapest I've found has been from Element14 #2144328.\n\n

\section FreedomFirmwareInstallation Installing USBDM firmware on FRDM-KL25Z
   Install the USBDM software and USBDM drivers before doing the following:  \n
   
   - Locate the USBDM_OpenSDA.sx file in the USBDM firmware folder.
   
<table border="0">
   <tr>
      <td width=400>This folder may be opened from the Windows Menu.</td>
      <td>Navigate to the MKxx folder.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>\image html BDMFlashImagesMenuItem.png</td>
      <td>\image html BDMFlashImagesFolder.png</td>
   </tr>
</table>
   The installation of the USBDM firmware uses the usual FRDM-KL25 OpenSDA bootloader process.\n
	- There are two firmware images for the FRDM board. These are OpenSDA applications.  
		- <b>USBDM_OpenSDA.sx</b> - Image with a fixed USB ID
		- <b>USBDM_OpenSDA_Unique_ID.sx</b> - Image with a USB ID that is determined from the device unique ID.

	Using the second of these images means that each BDM will be assigned a unique serial port number irrespective of which USB port is used. 
	This really only makes a difference if you have multiple BDMs and you don't want to play "find the com port number" under windows.\n
   These are OpenSDA applications.  The following process is used to load them into the FRDM board:
   - Unplug the FRDM-KL25 board.
   - Whilst holding the reset switch depressed plug in the FRDM-KL25 board.  The green LED should start blinking at a rate of about 1Hz.  
   - Open a file explorer and locate the USB drive that has now appeared.  It will have the drive name "BOOTLOADER".
   - Drag the file <b>USBDM_OpenSDAxxxxx.sx</b> to the USB drive and wait a short while.  The OpenSDA firmware on the FRDM-KL25 board will 
     program the USBDM firmware into the MK20 debugger chip on the board.
   - Remove and re-plug the FRDM-KL25 board.  The board will now appear as a USBDM device and USBDM driver installation will occur.
   
   You can test the interface by trying the stand-alone ARM flash programmer that is part of the USBDM installation. Placing a jumper on J-11
   will allow the programming of the MKL25Z128M4 chip on the FRDM board.  It is necessary to open J-11 and use the cable for external targets.
