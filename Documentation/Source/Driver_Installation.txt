\section InstallingDriversSectionWindows Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Windows
  
The driver installation has been considerably simplified from version 4.10.3 by the provision of a separate driver 
installation.  There are four installers provided: \n
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_WinXP_x32.msi</b> - Windows XP 32-bit
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_WinXP_x64.msi</b> - Windows XP 64-bit
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_Win_x32.msi</b> - Windows 7 32-bit
- <b>USBDM_Drivers_x_x_x_Win_x64.msi</b> - Windows 7 64-bit

<b>Note:</b> On Windows, libusb1.0 is a thin wrapper around the Microsoft winUSB low-level USB drivers.  Because
of this you may see references to winusb in the following.\n

Please install the drivers before plugging in a BDM. \n

Steps to follow under WIN-7 (its similar for WIN-XP but there will be other confirmation dialogues)
   - Download the appropriate driver installation file (as above) from Sourceforge:
   <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/usbdm/files/Version 4.10.6/Software/">USBDM Sourceforge</A>\n
   - Remove the BDM if it is already plugged in.
   - If you have installed a previous driver version (.msi file) and you wish to install a later version then
     use add/remove programs to uninstall the existing drivers first (look for the <b>USBDM drivers</b> entry).
   - Install the driver .msi file.  This should clean out any incompatible driver files.

     During the installation you may receive several prompts warning you that the drivers are not signed.  
     This is to be expected since I have not paid for them to be signed.\n

   - After installing the drivers, plugging in a BDM should trigger the actual driver installation. \n

   - If you click on the pop-up you can confirm the driver installation steps.\n
     In the case shown below drivers for the BDM interface and the serial port (CDC) interface are installed.

\section InstallingDriversSectionLinux Installation of USBDM USB drivers for Linux
There isn't any.  The DEB file provided will modify the /etc/udev/rules.d file to allow
access to the USBDM device. The required driver for USBDM BDM interface (LibusbV1) is included in the standard
Linux (at least Ubuntu current version).  The CDC (serial port) is a standard device and should also be installed
without any extra steps.

If more installation is required on your version you will have to investigate this yourself.  I'm not a Linux 
expert and I don't have access to other versions for testing.  If you find other steps are necessary then please
 advise and I will try to update the installation accordingly.

 \section LinuxDrivers Linux Drivers
 The shell scripts supplied with the linux version should install the required information for the libusb drivers 
 to work on a linux machine.
 
 You will also need to make sure you have installed some libraries:

  Hello PGO,
  
  I just tried your version 4.6 with Codewarrior 10.1 on a clean install of Ubuntu 11.04 (32 bit).
  In case it helps anyone else trying this, it required adding the following libraries with the 
  Synaptic Package Manager:
    - tcl8.5 
    - libwxgtk2.8-0 
    - lbwxgtk2.8-dbg 
    - libstdc++5 
    - libxerces-c3.1
  Then it seems to run fine.
  Many thanks and best regards!

 \section NoteOnFirmwareChange Note for upgrading from version 3.x to 4.x USBDM firmware
 
This change is complicated by the existence of a Bootloader in the BDM firmware.  If not replaced this
loader will continue to use the original VID/PID.  Because of this, it is desirable to completely replace the
BDM firmware. \n\n
For JS16 based BDMs this is a simple process since the Freescale JS12 Bootloader software may be 
used to replace all the firmware.  See \ref constructionPage. \n \n
For JMxx based BDMs it is necessary to use a HCS08 programmer to re-program the entire device so that the 
Bootloader is updated when the rest of firmware is changed. If a programmer is not available then it is still
possible to update the BDM firmware <i>using the Bootloader</i> but the Bootloader will remain unchanged.  
To do this it will be necessary to install the drivers twice - once for the old VID/PID used by the Bootloader
and again for the new VID/PID used by the main firmware.  Doing so will render any OSBDM drivers inoperable 
on that USB port.
