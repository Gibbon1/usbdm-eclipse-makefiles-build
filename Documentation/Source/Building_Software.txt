 \section sectionSoftwareNeeded Software Packages Needed
   USBDM makes use of the following packages under WIN32:
   - To build applications:
      - Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW)
      - wxWidgets
      - TCL
      - Xerces-c
   - To build the Windows installer package (.msi file)
      - Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolset
      - MSI Installer SDK V4.5
   - To build Eclipse plugin-ins for Codewarrior 10.x
      - Java SDK
      - Codewarrior 10.x 
   - To build firmware for BDMs
      - Codewarrior 10.2
   - To build documentation
      - Doxygen 
      
 \section sectionBuildingFirmware Building Firmware.
  
  The firmware for the HCS08 bdm is available as exported projects from Codewarrior 10.2.  It should be
  straightforward to import these and rebuild them using Codewarrior.
   - Unzip the archive.
   - Select import existing projects in Codewarrior.
     
 \section sectionBuildingApplications Building Applications. 
  To maintain portability between WIN32 and Linux I have chosen to use wxWidgets to provide the GUI.
  
  While I do the development using the Eclipse IDE I have found it difficult to provide a portable build
  environment since Eclipse seems to embed a great deal of machine specific information in the project settings.
  When moving the projects to another machine they were breaking in a fatal fashion - The project setting would 
  become unusable.  In any case this is not a practical approach since changing the project settings when moving
  between machine would be tedious.
  
  To solve this I have changed the projects to using make files.  This allows 
  the projects to be built outside of Eclipse or with Eclipse using Makefile based projects.
  Machine specific information is localised to one Makefile to allow convenient changes.   
  
  The following described setting up the required environment using currently available (May 2013) versions of the 
  needed packages.
   - Mingw 4.6.2 (32-bit) \n
   I installed to "c:\Apps\MinGW" \n
   Download mingw-get-inst-xxxx.exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-inst \n
   I suggest you follow the guidelines at http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started to install MinGW using the automatic installer.  You 
   will also need to install MSYS. \n
   
   - wxWidgets 2.9.4 \n
   I installed to "C:\Apps\wxWidgets-2.9.4" \n
   Download wxMSW-2.9.4-Setup.exe from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.4/ \n
   It is necessary to build wxWidgets libraries using the MinGW compiler.  Instructions for doing so area available in the README
   installed (search for MinGW).  I just used the simple make option.\n
   Command line used:  <b>mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=1 </b>\n 
   This will create the library and include files.

   - TCL (Active TCL 8.6.x.x) \n
   I installed to "C:\Apps\Tcl" \n
      - I took the easy route and just installed Active TCL from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads \n
      - As an alternative you should be able to use the TCL source files from Sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/files/Tcl/8.5.12/ 
      to build the TCL DLL using MinGW.\n
      - Note - All that is actually needed is the header files and the single DLL tcl86.dll that is provided in the USBDM install so you may not
      actually need to build TCL (I hope). 
   
   - Xerces-C 3.1 XML parser \n
   I installed the archive to "C:\Apps\xerces" \n
      - It is necessary to compile the xerces library using MinGW.  Download the sources from http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/ \n
        Build xerces libraries using the MinGW compiler.  Instructions for doing so area available here 
        http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/build-3.html \n
        Commands used: \n
        ./configure\n
		make libxerces_c_la_LDFLAGS="-release 3.1 -no-undefined"\n
		(Note the -no-undefined option is NOT used in the ./configure!)\n
		
   - Windows Installer 4.5 SDK (needed to build the Windows installer) \n
      This is part of Windows SDK for Windows 7.  I was unable to get this version to work so I used earlier non-official download of msi45sdk.msi.
        - Search for 'Windows Installer 4.5 SDK' or msi45sdk.msi to install the Windows installer by itself.
  
   - WiX Tool-set v3.7 (needed to build the Windows installer) \n
        - Download from http://wix.codeplex.com/
  
   - Building USBDM applications \n
      The following will build the applications and interface DLLs but not the Java related components.
        -# Download the source package from GITHUB - https://github.com/podonoghue 
        -# Edit the Common.mk file.  This file assumes the paths given above. Update paths as necessary
        -# Run the command <b>CollectExternalFiles</b>.  This collects external files.  If it complains, then locate the missing external files or
         correct the paths in the command file.
        -# Run the make command "make -f MakeAll.mk all"
  
\section Documentation
	The documentation is built in Eclipse using
	  - doxygen
	  	- http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
	  - Eclox plugin for Eclipse
	  	- http://home.gna.org/eclox/
	  - HTML Help compiler (to produced windows help files)
	  	- Download from Mircosoft
	If using windows XP you will need to change the HHC location to point to the HTML Help installation. (Advanced Tab, By Group, HTML Output) 

\section sectionJava Java & Eclipse plugins
  The required source files are included as part of the USBDM source package referred to in the above step.
  
  - USBDM JNI dll \n
    This is the Java native Interface for the USBDM interface DLL. It allows java code to access basic functions. 
      - Download and install a current Java SDK from Oracle: Java SE Development Kit 7 (32-bit) (Java SE 7u21, JDK)\n
      	Download from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html \n
   		I installed the standard location
      - Complete the steps given above for <b>Building USBDM applications</b>
      - Edit the MakeAll.mk file and add in the UsbdmJniWrapper_dll target to the list of targets
      - Run the make command "make -f MakeAll.mk all"
    
  - Codewarrior plugins \n
    No idea how to do these except from within Eclipse with Plugin development tools.
      - Install Eclipse with plugin development support (PDE). \n 
        Add Eclipse SDK (See Help->Install New Software, search for SDK). \n
        We are building plugins for the Codewarrior version of Eclipse so it is necessary to change the plugin target. \n
        - Select Window->Preferences.
        - Expand Plug-in Development->Target Platform.
        - Click Add on the first tab.
        - Use the wizard to add the plugin directory from a Codewarrior installation.
      - Follow the instructions at http://www.eclipse.org/swt/eclipse.php to download and install Eclipse SWT as a project in Eclipse.
        I used swt-3.7.2-win32-win32-x86_64.zip from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/.
      - You should be able now build the usbdmPligin_CW10_2 project.
