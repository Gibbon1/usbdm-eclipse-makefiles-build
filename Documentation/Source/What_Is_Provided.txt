 \subsection EclipseFiles Eclipse Archive Files
   - <b>The following files are archives exported from Eclipse CDT for windows.</b> \n
   To rebuild these projects you will need the following:
      - <b>Eclipse CDT</b>  \n This is C development environment for the Eclipse IDE. CDT may be obtained from http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/
      - <b>MinGW - Minimalist GNU for Windows</b> \n  This provides the C development tools (e.g. Compiler, linkers etc.) required for the
           windows platform.  These are used with the Eclipse IDE on a windows platform. These tools may be obtained from http://www.mingw.org/
      - <b>Doxygen</b> \n This is a tool for producing documention directly from suitably annotated code.  The source code files have
           been extensively commented in this fashion. This tool may be obtained from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/.
      - <b>eclox</b> \n This is a plugin for Eclipse that allows the convenient use of Doxygen from within Eclipse.  This plugin may
           be obtained from http://eclox.eu/
         
   -  <b>USBDM_Win32_xxxx.zip</b> \n
      - Source for the all DLL and executables. \n
      - Documentation source files used to generate help files etc.\n
      - HextoC \n
      Source for the conversion program used to convert S1S9 records into a C array for incorporation in the driver DLLs.
      This is used to embed the BDM Firmware images in the interface DLLs.  This allows
      automatic update of the JMxx version BDM firmware.
      
 \subsection CodeWarrior Codewarrior Projects
   <b>The following files are simple archives of Freescale Codewarrior for Microcontrollers V6.2 projects.</b> \n
   
   -  <b>USBDM_JMxx_xxxx.zip</b> \n
      Source for the firmware.  This is a simple Zip file of the Codewarrior V10 project.  Documentation for the C files
      may be generated with doxygen.
\if RS08
   -  <b>Flash_Programming_Routines.rar</b> \n
      This is the source code for the Flash programming routines that are downloaded to the various targets
      by the BDM when programming the on-chip Flash memory.
