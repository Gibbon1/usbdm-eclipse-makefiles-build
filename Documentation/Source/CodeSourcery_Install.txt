\page codeSourceryInstallPage Eclipse - Install (Codesourcery, GNU tools)

This page provides brief instructions on how to set up CodeSourcery Lite or GNU tools for use with 
Eclipse IDE and USBDM BDM hardware for Kinetis and Coldfire targets on a MS-Windows platform.
A similar setup works on Linux with obvious changes.

\section requiredSoftware Required Software
The following software needs to be installed:\n
-  <b>Eclipse Juno or Kepler</b> \n
   I do java programming as well as C so I usually download the Java version and add CDT plugins from scratch 
   (in the next step). 
   Alternatively, if only doing C programming then the CDT version can be downloaded.\n
   Download from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n
   Download either\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</b> (add CDT in next step)\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (only add the GDB plugins in next step)\n
   .
   Unzip to a suitable permanent location for the application e.g. "C:\Apps\Eclipse".\n
   Create a program object for the main eclipse application "C:\Apps\Eclipse\eclipse.exe" \n \n
-  <b>CDT GDB plugins (also CDT if Java only option was chosen above)</b> \n
   Launch Eclipse and select \b "Help->Install New Software..." from the menu.\n
   Click the \b Add button at the top-right of the dialogue.\n
   Complete as shown to add a repository for the CDT plugins.
   \verbatim
   CDT Plugin

   \endverbatim

   \n Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following items (versions may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   C/C++ Development Tools             8.1.1.201209170703
   C/C++ GCC Cross Compiler Support    1.1.0.201209170703
   C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging        7.0.0.201209170703	
   C/C++ Memory View Enhancements      2.2.0.201209170703
   \endverbatim
   \image html Install_CDT_Plugin_Selection.png 
   \n
   Click next and accept the various prompt to complete installation.  Reboot if prompted.\n \n
-  <b>Codesourcery Lite</b> \n
   Download from: http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/codesourcery \n
   Choose the software for the appropriate target.  Codesourcery has versions to support Coldfire and ARM targets.  For ARM
   I prefer the ARM Ltd tools described next as they appear more complete.\n 
   Run the installer to install to the default location.
   There is no need to allow the installer to modify the PATHs  . \n \n
-  <b>ARM Ltd GNU Tools for Arm</b> \n
   This is an alternative to the Codesourcery tools for ARM.  A significant advantage is the inclusion of
   floating point libraries supporting the single-precision FPU on some chips.  It also has a wider range of options
   for reduced size versions printf etc.\n
   Download from: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded \n
   Choose the software for the appropriate target.\n 
   Run the installer to install to the default location.
   The is no need to allow the installer to modify the PATHs. \n \n
-  <b>USBDM Eclipse plugin</b> \n
   This plugin makes it very easy to create USBDM based projects for Coldfire & Kinetis devices. It also adds an
   ARM register view to the debugger.\n
   It is installed as part of the USBDM installation in the following step. \n
   When  using the windows installer it will be necessary to manually select this item for installation and
   browse to the appropriate directory as Eclipse installations do not have a standard installation location. \n
   Under Linux the installer will attempt to locate Eclipse in a number of standard locations.\n
-  <b>Install USBDM</b> \n
   This must be done <b>after</b> installing Eclipse since it adds Eclipse plugins.\n
