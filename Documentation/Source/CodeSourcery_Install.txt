\section requiredSoftware Required Software

This page provides brief instructions on how to set up CodeSourcery Lite or GNU tools for use with 
Eclipse IDE and USBDM BDM hardware for Kinetis and Coldfire targets on a MS-Windows platform.
A similar setup works on Linux with obvious changes.\n
<b>It is important that this software is installed before installing USBDM as USBDM must place plugin components into the already present Eclipse installation</b>

The following software needs to be installed:\n
-  <b>Eclipse Juno or Kepler</b> \n
   I do java programming as well as C so I usually download the Java version and add CDT plugins from scratch 
   (in the next step). 
   
   Alternatively, if only doing C programming then the CDT version can be downloaded.\n
   Download from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n
   Download either\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</b> (add CDT in next step)\n
   \image html EclipseJavaIDELink.png
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (only add the GDB plugins in next step)\n
   \image html EclipseC++IDELink.png
   .
   Unzip to a suitable permanent location for the application e.g. "C:\Apps\Eclipse".\n
   Create a program object for the main eclipse application "C:\Apps\Eclipse\eclipse.exe" \n \n
-  <b>CDT GDB plugins (also CDT if Java only option was chosen above)</b> \n
   Launch Eclipse and select \b "Help->Install New Software..." from the menu.\n
   \image html Help_InstallNewSoftware_Menu.png
   
   Click the \b Add button at the top-right of the dialogue.\n

   Complete as shown to add a repository for the CDT plugins.
   \verbatim
   Eclipse CDT
   http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/kepler
   \endverbatim
   \image html Add_CDT_Repository.png
   \n Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following items (versions may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   C/C++ Development Tools             x.x.x.xxxxxxxxxxxx
   C/C++ GCC Cross Compiler Support    x.x.x.xxxxxxxxxxxx
   C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging        x.x.x.xxxxxxxxxxxx	
   C/C++ Memory View Enhancements      x.x.x.xxxxxxxxxxxx
   \endverbatim
   \image html Install_CDT_Plugin_Selection.png 
   Click next and accept the various prompts to complete installation.\n
   Restart Eclipse if prompted.\n
-  <b>Codesourcery Lite (Coldfire Targets) </b> \n
   Download from: http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/codesourcery \n
   Download the <b>Lite Edition</b> not the evaluations which are more complete but time limited.
   Choose the software for the appropriate target.  Codesourcery has versions to support Coldfire and ARM targets.\n
   For ARM I prefer the ARM Ltd tools described next as they appear more complete.\n 
   There are different versions available for Windows and Linux
   \image html CodesourceryBasicVersions.png
   Run the installer to install to the default location.
   There is no need to allow the installer to modify the PATHs as the USBDM Eclipse plugin allows this to be set from within Eclipse. \n \n
-  <b>ARM Ltd GNU Tools (ARM Targets) </b> \n
   Download from: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded \n
   This is the preferred alternative for ARM.  A significant advantage over the Codesourcery version is the inclusion of
   floating point libraries supporting the single-precision FPU on some chips.  It also has a range of options
   for the use of reduced size versions of printf etc.\n
   Choose the software for the appropriate platform.\n 
   Run the installer to install to the default location.
   There is no need to allow the installer to modify the PATHs as the USBDM Eclipse plugin allows this to be set from within Eclipse. \n \n
-  <b>Install the USBDM Eclipse Plugin</b> \n
   The USBDM Eclipse plugin is available as part of the standard USBDM installation process.\n
   This plugin makes it very easy to create USBDM based projects for Coldfire & Kinetis devices. It also adds an
   ARM register view to the debugger.\n
   When  using the windows installer it will be necessary to manually select this item for installation and
   browse to the appropriate directory as Eclipse does not have a standard installation location. \n
   \image html SelectingPluginInstallation.png
   Under Linux the installer will attempt to locate Eclipse in a number of standard locations:
   - /usr/local/eclipse
   - /usr/lib/eclipse
   - /opt/eclipse
   
   This installation must be done <b>after</b> installing Eclipse since it adds Eclipse plugins.\n
