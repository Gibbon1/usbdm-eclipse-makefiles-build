\page codeSourceryInstallPage Eclipse - Install (Codesourcery, GNU tools)

This page provides brief instructions on how to set up CodeSourcery Lite or GNU tools for use with 
Eclipse IDE and USBDM BDM hardware for Kinetis and Coldfire targets on a MS-Windows platform.
A similar setup works on Linux with obvious changes.

\section requiredSoftware Required Software
The following software needs to be installed:\n
-  <b>Eclipse Juno or Kepler</b> \n
   I do java programming as well as C so I usually download the Java version and add CDT plugins from scratch 
   (in the next step). 
   Alternatively, if only doing C programming then the CDT version can be downloaded.\n
   Download from: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\n
   Download either\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</b> (add CDT in next step)\n
   -  <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (only add the GDB plugins in next step)\n
   .
   Unzip to a suitable permanent location for the application e.g. "C:\Apps\Eclipse".\n
   Create a program object for the main eclipse application "C:\Apps\Eclipse\eclipse.exe" \n \n
-  <b>CDT GDB plugins (also CDT if Java only option was chosen above)</b> \n
   Launch Eclipse and select \b "Help->Install New Software..." from the menu.\n
   Click the \b Add button at the top-right of the dialogue.\n
   Complete as shown to add a repository for the CDT plugins.
   \verbatim
   CDT Plugin
   http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/juno
   \endverbatim

   \n Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following items (versions may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   C/C++ Development Tools             8.1.1.201209170703
   C/C++ GCC Cross Compiler Support    1.1.0.201209170703
   C/C++ GDB Hardware Debugging        7.0.0.201209170703	
   C/C++ Memory View Enhancements      2.2.0.201209170703
   \endverbatim
   \image html Install_CDT_Plugin_Selection.png 
   \n
   Click next and accept the various prompt to complete installation.  Reboot if prompted.\n \n
-  <b>Codesourcery Lite</b> \n
   Download from: http://www.mentor.com/embedded-software/codesourcery \n
   Choose the software for the appropriate target.\n 
   Run the installer to install to the default location.
   There is no need to allow the installer to modify the PATHs  . \n \n
-  <b>ARM Ltd GNU Tools for Arm</b> \n
   This is an alternative to the Codesourcery tools for ARM.  A significant advantage is the inclusion of
   floating point libraries supporting the single-precision FPU on some chips.\n
   Download from: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded \n
   Choose the software for the appropriate target.\n 
   Run the installer to install to the default location.
   The is no need to allow the installer to modify the PATHs. \n \n
-  <b>USBDM Eclipse plugin</b> \n
   This plugin makes it very easy to create USBDM based projects for Coldfire & Kinetis devices. \n
   Under windows it is installed as part of the USBDM installation in the following step.  Note that it will be 
   necessary to manually select this item for installation and browse to the appropriate directory as Eclipse 
   installations do not have a standard installation location. \n  
   Under linux it is necessary to manually copy the plugin files to the Eclipse <b>dropins</b> directory.  \n
-  <b>Install USBDM</b> \n
   This must be done <b>after</b> installing Eclipse since it adds Eclipse plugins.\n
*/

-  <b>ARM for Eclipse plugin (Not all BDMs support ARM)</b> \n
   In theory it's possible to set up Eclipse for a ARM target from scratch using the GCC Cross Compiler Support plugin.  
   In practice the ARM for Eclipse plugin makes setting up a project much easier.
   Information about this plugin is available at http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/blog/ \n
   This plugin can be installed in the same way as the CDT plugin above.  Just add the following repository:
   \verbatim
   ARM Plugin
   http://gnuarmeclipse.sourceforge.net/updates 
   \endverbatim
   Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following item (version may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   GNU ARM C/C++ Development Support    0.5.4.201202210114
   \endverbatim
   Complete the process and reboot if prompted. \n \n
-  <b>USBDM Eclipse plugin</b> \n
   This plugin makes it very easy to create GDB based launch configurations for Coldfire and ARM targets using the
   USBDM interface.  
   This plugin can be installed in the same way as the CDT plugin above.  Just add the following repository:
   \verbatim
   USBDM Plugin
   http://usbdm.sourceforge.net/EclipseUpdates
   \endverbatim
   Select the added item at the top of the dialogue and then select the following item (version may vary):\n
   \verbatim
   USBDM Plugin for Eclipse CDT 4.10.5.xxxx
   \endverbatim
   Complete the process and reboot if prompted. \n \n
