  \mainpage USBDM-FRDM - USBDM Debugger based on Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board

 \section introSection Introduction
   The FRM-KL25 board from Freescale includes a minimal SWD based debugging interface for ARM Kinetis targets.  The interface
   hardware is simple but flexible enough to be used with a wide range of Kinetis devices.  The board includes provision for 
   the connector necessary to allow programming of external devices as well as the MKL25Z128M4 device on the board.  
   
   Unfortunately the debugger firmware available with the FRDM-KL25 is specifically tied to the target chip on the FRDM board 
   (MKL25Z128M4).  In fact, it is tied to the individual serial number of the chip on the board and cannot be even used to program other
   MKL25Z128M4 devices.  Changing the chip on the board renders the debugging interface useless. 
   
   This manual describes a version of the USBDM firmware that can be loaded into the KL20 based debugging interface of the FRDM board.
   This allows its use as a general purpose programmer and debugger for Kinetis devices (including the KL25 on the board).  This provides a
   very inexpensive debugger tool.
    
 \subsection featureSection Features
   This version of the USBDM code combined with the FRDM-KL25 board provides the following features:
   -	A SWD interface for programming and debugging of <b>Kinetis ARM-Cortex</b> microcontrollers.
   -  Both the on-board MKL25Z128M4 and external devices may be programmed.
   -  Installation of the USBDM software does not require any tools other than the FRDM-KL25Z board.
   -  The original board software may be restored if USBDM is not found suitable.  
   -  Compatible IDEs
      - Codewarrior V10.x (Eclipse version)
         - Kinetis <i>USBDM debug interface</i>
      - Eclipse JUNO
         - Kinetis <i>New Project Wizard</i>
         - Kinetis <i>USBDM debug target</i>
         - Integration of CodeSourcery Lite for ARM
   -  Linux compatible
   -  Window compatible
   -  The Firmware in the BDM may be updated using the FRDM-KL25 Bootloader function.
   -  Stand-alone Kinetis programmer utility.

<b>The capabilities and features of the USBDM interface varies between the different versions of hardware. 
Not all of the functionality described in the following pages may apply to this version.</b>

 \section sectionCredits Credits
   -  The original base code is taken from the TBDML, OSBDM and TBLCF projects and I very much appreciate
      the effort involved in producing the original code.  I hope this extension will be useful.
