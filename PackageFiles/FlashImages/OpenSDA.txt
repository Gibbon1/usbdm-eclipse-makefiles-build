The USBDM_OpenSDAxxx.sx flash images are USBDM firmware for FRDM-xxxx boards.  This can
be used as cheap Kinetis programmers.

Versions:
USBDM_OpenSDA.sx              Firmware with serial number 0001
USBDM_OpenSDA_Unique_ID.sx    Firmware with device specific serial number, i.e. each BDM has an unique ID

The first is useful if you are using BDMs as a 'class set' as it means that each BDM should end up appearing 
as the same serial port e.g. COM8.
The second version is useful if you wish to use two BDMs on the same machine at the same time as the COM port
used will be tied to the BDM i.e. each BDM will end up with a board specific COM port even if plugged into 
another USB port.

These are OpenSDA application and is loaded by the following actions:

(Before doing the following install the USBDM drivers).

*  Unplug FRDM-KL25 board
*  Whilst holding the reset switch depressed plug in the FRDM-KL25 board.  The
   green LED should start blinking at about 1Hz.  
*  Open a file explorer and locate the USB drive that has now appeared.  It will have
   the drive name "BOOTLOADER"
*  Drag the USBDM_OpenSDA.sx to the USB drive and wait a short while.  The OpenSDA firmware
   on the FRDM-KL25 board will program the USBDM firmware into the MK20 debugger chip on the
   board.
*  Remove and re-plug the FRDM-KL25 board.  The board will now appear as a USBDM device.
