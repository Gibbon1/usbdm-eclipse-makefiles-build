The OpenSDAxxx.sx flash images are USBDM firmware for FRDM-xxxx boards.  This can
be used as cheap Kinetis programmers.

Versions:
===========
Open-SDA Version 1 - Used with most FRDM boards
OpenSDA.sx              Firmware with serial number 0001
OpenSDA_Unique_ID.sx    Firmware with device specific serial number, i.e. each BDM has an unique ID

Open-SDA Version 2.0 - Used with FRM-K64F (MBED version of Freedom boards)
OpenSDAv2_0.sx             Firmware with serial number 0001
OpenSDAv2_0_Unique_ID.sx   Firmware with device specific serial number, i.e. each BDM has an unique ID

Open-SDA Version 2.1 - Used with FRM-K22F (newer MBED version of Freedom boards)
OpenSDAv2_1.sx             Firmware with serial number 0001
OpenSDAv2_1_Unique_ID.sx   Firmware with device specific serial number, i.e. each BDM has an unique ID

The first version of each firmware is useful if you are using BDMs as a 'class set' as it means that each BDM 
should end up appearing as the same serial port e.g. COM8.
The second version is useful if you wish to use two BDMs on the same machine at the same time as the COM port
used will be tied to the BDM i.e. each BDM will end up with a board specific COM port even if plugged into 
another USB port.  This means the COM numbers doesn't change each time you plug in the BDM.

These are OpenSDA application and is loaded by the following actions:

(Before doing the following install the USBDM drivers).

*  Unplug FRDM-XXXX board
*  Whilst holding the reset switch depressed plug in the FRDM-XXXX board.  The
   green LED should start blinking at about 1Hz (OpenSDA V1 only).  
*  Open a file explorer and locate the USB drive that has now appeared.  It will have
   the drive name "BOOTLOADER"
*  Drag the OpenSDAX.sx to the USB drive and wait a short while.  The OpenSDA firmware
   on the FRDM-XXXX board will program the USBDM firmware into the MK20 debugger chip on the
   board.
*  In the case of the Open-SDAV2 device the BOOTLOADER Disk will disappear.
*  Remove and re-plug the FRDM-XXXX board.  The board will now appear as a USBDM device.
